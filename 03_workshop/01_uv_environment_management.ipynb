    "\n",
    "Virtual environments are isolated Python installations that allow you to:\n",
    "- Install different package versions for different projects\n",
    "- Avoid conflicts between project dependencies  \n",
    "- Keep your system Python clean\n",

    "- Installs packages 10-100x faster than pip\n",
    "- Provides reliable dependency resolution\n",
    "- Works seamlessly with existing Python tools\n",
    "- Has excellent virtual environment management\n",
