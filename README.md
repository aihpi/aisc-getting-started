<h1> KISZ Getting Started
</div>

This repository provides a comprehensive getting started guide for people new to development workflows. Learn how to set up your development environment, work with Python virtual environments, Docker containers, and AI tools like Ollama - all from scratch!

## Workshop Context

This repository introduces the essential development tools and workflows used in workshops offered by the **AI Service Center Berlin-Brandenburg**. We strongly recommend completing the installation process before attending workshops, particularly if you plan to actively engage with the AI applications and development environments demonstrated during the sessions.

**Need assistance?** If you encounter any issues during installation, please contact us at **kisz@hpi.de** for technical support.

**Not ready to install?** Most workshops welcome participants without prior setup completion. When in doubt, contact your workshop instructor to clarify technical requirements for your specific session.

## What You'll Learn

- **Development Environment Setup**: Install and configure VS Code, Git, and Python
- **Python Environment Management**: Master UV for creating and managing virtual environments
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Learn to use Jupyter for interactive development
- **Docker Containers**: Build and run applications in containerised environments
- **AI/LLM Integration**: Set up and use Ollama for local language model development
- **Real-world Application**: Build a simple chatbot that uses local AI models

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide is designed for people who have basic computer skills but may be new to:
- Command line/terminal usage
- Programming environments and package management
- Docker and containerisation
- AI/ML development workflows

## Getting Started

Choose your operating system to begin the setup process:

### Setup Guides by Operating System

- **[Windows Setup Guide](windows-setup.md)** - Complete setup including WSL installation
- **[macOS Setup Guide](macos-setup.md)** - Native macOS development environment
- **[Linux Setup Guide](linux-setup.md)** - For Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions

### Quick Overview

1. **Install VS Code** - Your development environment
2. **Set up GitHub** - Version control and repository access
3. **Clone this repository** - Get the learning materials
4. **Install Python 3.11** - Programming language (WSL for Windows users)
5. **Install UV** - Python environment management
6. **Install Jupyter** - Interactive notebook environment
7. **Install Docker Desktop** - Containerisation platform
8. **Install Ollama** - Local AI model server
9. **Run the example application** - Test your complete setup

## Learning Path

After completing the setup, follow these hands-on tutorials in order:

1. **[Overview](03_workshop/00_overview.ipynb)** - Understanding the learning structure
2. **[UV Environment Management](03_workshop/01_uv_environment_management.ipynb)** - Master Python virtual environments
3. **[Jupyter Basics](03_workshop/02_jupyter_basics.ipynb)** - Interactive development with notebooks
4. **[Ollama and LLM Prompting](03_workshop/03_ollama_and_llm_prompting.ipynb)** - AI model integration

## Example Application

This repository includes a complete chatbot application that demonstrates all the technologies you'll learn:

- **Frontend**: React-based chat interface (`01_frontend/`)
- **Backend**: FastAPI server with Ollama integration (`02_backend/`)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose setup for easy deployment

### Running the Application

After completing the setup guide for your operating system:

```bash
# Start the complete application stack
docker-compose up -d

# Access the chatbot
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend API: http://localhost:8000
```

## Verification

Each setup step includes verification commands to ensure everything is working correctly. The final verification is running the example chatbot application.
